Inhauck Website repo
This is my website. Here, I will include several parts of my professional life, and some of my personal projects/interests. This site is mostly for me to expand my programming skillset, while also showing off some of the things I like to do.
Some of the things I plan to include on this website: 
  - Cool pictures I took
  - Places I've been
  - Library reviews
  - (More to come)
